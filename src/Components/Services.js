						Installation steps typically include job planning, layout,
						excavating and compacting the soil subgrade, applying geotextiles
						(optional), spreading and compacting the sub-base and/or base
						aggregates, constructing edge, restraints, placing and screeding the
						bedding sand, placing concrete pavers, compacting concrete pavers,
						sweeping in jointing sand and final compaction. It is imperative
						that your installer is fully ICPI certified.
