					<h2>About Malibu Landscaping & Lawn Service</h2>
					<p>
						Malibu Landscaping & Lawn Service is family-owned and operated in
						Charlotte, NC. Since opening in 2010, we’ve treated every customer
						like they were a part of our family. Other companies may offer
						similar services, but our services come with a personal touch.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use only the best quality products across the board. For example,
						our Volt Outdoor lights, Architectural lights and Security lights
						all come with a Lifetime transferable Warranty. By the way, LED
						landscape lighting is fast becoming the predominant choice for
						discerning home owners. Three factors that make VOLT® LED landscape
						and garden lighting so popular are luminosity, light quality and
						durability. VOLT® uses industry leading photometric techniques to
						ensure the maximum light output per watt consumed for each of our
						LED landscape lighting fixtures. VOLT® also makes use of the highest
						quality Light Emitting Diodes and driver technology to ensure each
						and every one of our LED landscape lighting fixtures produce
						consistent and natural light, making our LED fixtures
						indistinguishable from standard high quality halogen fixtures. Our
						super-efficient designs allow our all-in-one integrated LED
						landscape lighting fixtures to outlast the competition and for this
						reason be covered by our Lifetime transferrable manufacturer's
						warranty. LED Flood Lighting LED Pathway Lights LED In-Grade Lights
						LED Deck & Patio Lighting LED Outdoor Step Lighting LED Hardscape
						Lighting are just a few of the many lighting options. As for our
						Belgard Hardscape products, they also come with a Lifetime Warranty
						(you can't go wrong with a Lifetime Guarantee!). And finally, our
						seed and fertilizers are the absolute best available.
